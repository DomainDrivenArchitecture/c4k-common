## Purpose

c4k-common ....

## Rational

There are many comparable solutions for creating c4k deployments like helm or kustomize. Why do we need another one?
* We like the simplicity of kustomize. Yaml in, yaml out, the ability to lint the result and the option to split large yaml files into objects. But a simple overwriting per environment may not be enough ...
* We like helm packages. A package encapsulates the setup for an application. On the one hand, but on the other hand we don't like the idea of having to program and debug in a template language. We can program much better in real programming languages.

Our convention 4 kubernetes c4k-* tools combine the advantages of both approaches:
* Packages for one application
* Programming in clojure
* yaml / edn as input and output, no more magic
* good validation, integration as api, cli or in the browser
